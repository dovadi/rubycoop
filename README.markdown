Proposal for a formal (commercial) cooperative with Ruby developers as members to implement/build paid projects for customers.

Background
----------

Is it possible to work together on a commercial basis as individual developers more or less the same way as an Open Source project:

Members advantages:
-------------------

* Acquisition as a collective
* More flexible in workload
* Share knowledge
* More change to do what you do best (specialties)

Customer benefits:
------------------

* More continuity, less dependent on a single developer or a small company
*
