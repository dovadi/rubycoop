Proposal for a formal (commercial) cooperative with Ruby developers as members to implement/build paid projects for customers.

Background
----------

Is it possible to work together on a commercial basis as individual developers more or less the same way we contribute to an Open Source project. 

1. Basically a core team of at least two member accept the responsibilities for the assignment. 
2. Every member can contribute to the project on the basis of a feature or a specification. 
3. Each member is paid for their contribution.

Members advantages:
-------------------

* Acquisition as a collective.
* More flexible in workload. No more running or standing still. A more even distribution of the workload.
* Higher occupation on average.
* Share knowledge and pratical experience.
* Learn by working together on the same project.
* More change to do what you do best (specialties).
* More change to make some money as a parttime ruby developer.
* Development of a toolkit (practices, patterns, libraries/modules)

Customer benefits:
------------------

* More continuity, less dependent on a single developer or a small company.
* Because of the higher occupation of the members a more competative hourly fee can be offered.


Startup
-------

What are the minimal requirements for starting up the Ruby Co-Op?

* The minimal number of members?
* A minimal number of assignments before the Co-Op formally starts?
* Do we need members in one Country/Region/Timezone ?
