**What are succesfull co-operatives as an example for the Ruby Co-op?**

[Calcedon](http://www.calcedon.com/about/career)

Calcedon is a bleeding-edge company, and we don’t limit our progressive thinking to just technology.

We’ve adopted a Co-op model of doing business to create a better community of developers, and better results for our customers.

Hate turning away projects you don’t have time for?
Hate working alone?
Hate doing Sales? Marketing? Management?

The Calcedon Co-op is perfect for developers and designers who freelance or work on projects part-time, but miss the team environment or have trouble finding projects that are just big enough for them and their time. The cooperative allows the benefits of a freelancer, while removing those aspects of a freelancer that you don’t like (i.e. working alone, management of clients, sales, development, etc… do only what you enjoy!).

Benefits:

* Receive work from the Co-op
* Work on what you want
* Sales commission for directing work to the Co-op
* Work on teams for projects that need more than one asset
* Management commission for projects you manage
* Allow Calcedon to help you do more
