Proposal for a formal (commercial) cooperative with Ruby developers as members to implement/build paid projects for customers.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So you're an independent Ruby developer with all the _benefits_ you can think of. 

With a lot of **freedom**. You work from home, you choose your own assignments, no adjustment to a corporate culture, no managers to deal with etc. 

But what about the **downsides**? No feedback on your work (from which you can learn), not a lot of interaction with other programmers, not easy to consult a colleague on technical or other matters and sometimes the workload is too much or too little.

So that leads me to the question: is there a form of working together without losing the valued benefits of an independent developer.  Somehow it must be possible to work together on a commercial basis as individual developers more or less the same way we contribute to an Open Source project.

Living in a community (on an island) where we have a lot of benefit of existing co-operatives (for [transport by ferry](https://teso.nl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=102&Itemid=69&lang=en) and the [delivery of energy](http://texelenergie.nl/)), I of course thought of a formal co-operative as an organization form for working as an collective.

Benefits:
---------

>* Acquisition as a collective.
>* More flexible in workload. No more running or standing still. A more even distribution of the workload.
>* Higher occupation on average.
>* Share knowledge and practical experience.
>* Learn by working together on the same project.
>* More change to do what you do best (specialties).
>* More change to make some money as a part time ruby developer.

The co-op will also offer the customer more continuity. A customer will value the lower dependence on a single developer or a small company.

Release early, release often:
----------------------------

With this proposal I like to research the possibility of working together in a formal co-operative. Of course I don't have all the answers (yet), but I'm hoping that we can together answer a lot of them.

Let me know what **you** think. I made a first draft of a proposal on Github with the following subjects:

>* Definitions
>* Objectives
>* Rights
>* Responsibilities
>* Obligations
>* Financials
>* Board
>* Workflow
>* Examples

I like to invite you to **join this discussion** and **make your contribution** by forking and submitting your patches!
